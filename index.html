    <p>BTS is a <strong>South Korean boy band</strong> formed under record label Big Hit Entertainment, composed of three rappers (RM, Suga, and J-Hope) and four vocalists (Jin, Jimin, V, and Jungkook). The group's debut single album 2 Cool 4 Skool (2013) and subsequent extended play (EP) O!RUL8,2? (2013), despite achieving little commercial success,[1] garnered them several new artist awards during late 2013 and early 2014. The group released its second EP Skool Luv Affair (2014) and first studio album Dark & Wild (2014) the following year, to a quieter awards reception; Skool Luv Affair's lead single, "Boy in Luv", received a nomination for Best Dance Performance (Male) at the <span class="text"> Mnet Asian Music Awards</span>, while Dark & Wild won a Disc Bonsang[a] at the 2015 Golden Disc Awards. BTS' third EP The Most Beautiful Moment in Life, Pt. 1 (2015), won the Disc Bonsang at the 2016 Golden Disc Awards, while its lead single "I Need U" received the Best Male Dance award at the 2015 Melon Music Awards. The group's follow up EP, The Most Beautiful Moment in Life, Pt. 2 (2015), received an Album of the Year nomination at the 2016 Gaon Chart Music Awards, for the fourth quarter.[b] BTS' first Korean compilation album The Most Beautiful Moment in Life: Young Forever (2016) earned BTS their first daesang[c] award for Album of the Year at the 2016 Melon Music Awards and Artist of the Year at the 2016 Mnet Asian Music Award
